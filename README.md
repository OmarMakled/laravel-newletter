- 1 QA Engineer: Working on average 5 days a week.
- API Development and Front-End Development can be completed in ~6-7 weeks.
- QA and Final Testing can be completed in parallel, ensuring the entire project can be wrapped up within 8 weeks.
- Total Estimated Duration: ~8 weeks

### Code standard & Deploying

- For the frontend, we will use `ESLint` for linting and `Prettier` for code formatting. For the PHP backend, we will use `PHP_CodeSniffer`.

- Husky is used to manage Git hooks and ensure that code style checks are run before commits.

- CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins.

- Deploying on AWS.
